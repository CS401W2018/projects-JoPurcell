        <h2>Engagement Questions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>What are the positives and negatives of hosting your videos on YouTube?</li>
                YouTube doesn't care about valid HTML. Hosting your video on YouTube is free. However, ads will occur. 
            <li>What is the most useful thing you can do with a transform?</li>
                Transform allows us to format things around our page such as rotation.
            <li>How do you stay safe online?</li>
                We must ensure that every information we share online is secure. Refrain from sharing sensitive information and if you do, make sure the source can be trusted. We can also try having a security certificate/license to ensure our safety online.
            <li>What is the schedule for the rest of the class?</li>
                We will have final exam practice next week Monday. We only have Monday and Wednesday next week, then a reading day on December 6.
