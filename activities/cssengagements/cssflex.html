            <li>What have you learned about CSS Grid and CSS Flex?</li>
            <p>CSS flex allows the children elements to take up how much space they want. Grid has the parents control the children elements and put them in a space they tell them to go too.</p>
            <li>Why do you need to have an accessible website? What does that mean?</li>
            <p>We have to allow everyone to access our website. This includes those who are with disabilities. Everyone must have the ability to read and access our website.</p>
