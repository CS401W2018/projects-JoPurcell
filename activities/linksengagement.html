    <h3>Explain the difference between an absolute link and a relative link. Why would you use relative links?</h3>
    <p>Absolute links show the whole domain in the url. It contains the entire address to the webpage or website we are linking inside our HTML. Relative links do not show the whole domain or address. This is because it links files from your website ONLY. Instead of using the entire address, you use the file name of what you want to link on your web page.</p>
    <h3>3 Rules with Relative Links</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>One period (.) represents the current folder you are in</li>
        <li>Two periods (..) represents the parent folder. It also serves as us going up a folder or backwards of the filepath.</li>
        <li>Forward Slash (/) means to start at the root or the beginning.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Do links always need to be inside a NAV tag?</h3>
    <p>Links do not necessarily have to be in a NAV tag. Links can exist outside the NAV tag anywhere in our file.</p>
