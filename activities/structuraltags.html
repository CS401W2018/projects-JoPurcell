    <h2>What goes in the header?</h2>
    <p>The brand or organization name, navigation and the search bar.</p>
    <h2>What goes in the Nav? Can the Nav go in the header? Does it have to go in the header? Does the Nav contain links to another website?</h2>
    <p>Quick links and other parts of our website go in the navigation. It can be put in the header, but there is no problem with it going outside of the header. It should contain links to other webpages of the website, but not another website.</p>
    <h2>What goes in Main?</h2>
    <p>The main content of the webpage.</p>
    <h2>What goes in the Footer?</h2>
    <p></p>
