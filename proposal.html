    <main>
        <h2>Topic: Samoa</h2>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>I thought I could make a twist on the photo tour project and make a site on what each of the places mean to me. I miss home too a little bit, and I feel working on this project can help me share what I love about my homeland.</p>
        <h2>What will be on the home page?</h2>
            <p>On the home page, I will have a brief history on Samoa and some important and interesting information about the country. I will also list out the other pages and a brief preview of their content.</p>
        <h2>Page Contents</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Culture and its significance</li>
            <li>Sports History (where the table will be)</li>
            <li>Landmarks</li>
            <li>Attractions</li>
            <li>My Home</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I will be collecting data on sports teams from Samoa and place them in the table. I will be focusing on the dominant sports in the country being rugby and volleyball. I will try searching this information using;</p>
