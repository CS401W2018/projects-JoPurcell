                    <h2>Loid Forger</h2>
                    <p>Loid Forger is really a spy, code name; Twilight. He became a spy because he wanted to create a world where children will not have to cry and feel powerless. The master of disguise, clever and cunning, but sometimes tends to make quick assumptions about people based on their expressions. Don't believe me? Just ask Yor.</p>

                    <p>She was adopted by Loid from an orphanage. She has been with four previous families and was returned each time. She is a telepath.

                    <p>An ordinary woman by day and an assassin by night. Yor Forger is the adoptive mother and wife of Loid Forger. She is very protective of Anya and tries to perform her motherly duties as best she can (except cooking. It's terrible!) She is a strong fighter, but can be clueless out of her work as an assassin sometimes.</p>
