                    <h2>Falealupo</h2>
                    <p>A village on the far side of Savaii, Falealupo is the place to watch the sunset.</p>

                    <h2>Tosua Trench</h2>
                    <p>To-sua means 'giant swimming hole', it is 30 meters deep and you can access the pool by climbing down a long ladder to a platform (as shown in the photo). A cave is inside that leads to the open sea and is recommended for skilled divers.</p>

                    <h2>Papase'ea Sliding Rocks</h2>
                    <p>Papase'ea is what I would like to call "the Nature Waterslide". This is situated inland in the Faleata district and is great place for swimming and sliding.</p>

                    <h2>Piula Cave Pool</h2>
                    <p>A beautiful freshwater spring pool with a cave that originated from an old lava tube. Piula cave pool is a great destination for swimming and cooling off from the heat! The underwater cave connects to another cave. My grandfather loved swimming here and used to tell many stories about taking my aunties and uncles to swim there. However, due to weather changes swimming to the second cave can be risky.</p>

                    <h2>John Williams Memorial</h2>
                    <p>Loid Forger is really a spy, code name; Twilight. He became a spy because he wanted to create a world where children will not have to cry and feel powerless. The master of disguise, clever and cunning, but sometimes tends to make quick assumptions about people based on their expressions. Don't believe me? Just ask Yor.</p>
