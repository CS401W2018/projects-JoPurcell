        <h2>The Islands of Samoa</h2>
        <p>There are ten islands in Samoa. However, only 5 are inhabited. The inhabited islands are;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Upolu</li>
            <li>Savaii</li>
            <li>Apolima</li>
            <li>Manono</li>
            <li>Namu'a</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Upolu</h3>
            <p>This island is normally called 'Apia' because of the capital. It spans 75km (246063ft) in length and has a total area of 1125 square kilometres. Upolu offers more resorts and experiences because it is the capital island. However, you will still find the culture in the rural areas. There are many beautiful places to visit in Upolu and you will find them in the <a href="landmarks.html">Landmarks</a> page.</p>

        <h3>Savaii</h3>
            <p>The biggest island of Samoa as it is 80 km long and 40 km wide. The big island of Savaii offers an opportunity to disconnect and relax. It is only an hour trip away from Mulifanua wharf in Upolu to Salelologa wharf. Personally, I would go to Savaii to live for my whole life (because I HAVE been there most of my life!).</p>

        <h3>Apolima</h3>
            <p>One of the smaller islands that lies between Upolu and Savaii in the Apolima Strait. It is only 5 kilometres (approximately 16404 ft) in diameter. Apolima was formed from an inactive volcano crater. You can visit the island and have an authentic glimpse of the Samoan way of life as it has been for centuries.</p>
