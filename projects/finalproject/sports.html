        <p>Sports are a BIG deal for the Samoan community. They believe in being active from a young age and getting involved in a lot of physical activities other than farming and gardening. The MOST dominant sports in Samoa include;</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Rugby</li>
            <li>Volleyball</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Though there are also other sports, such as basketball, track and field, cricket, etc. The above two are the most dominant in every community. When you plan on driving around in the afternoons, you would find in almost every village people playing volleyball in their dirt courts and rugby in their front lawns.</p>    
        
        <h2>Rugby</h2>
        <p>Rugby has a strong hold and great meaning to Samoa.</p>
