        <h2>Sports & the Community</h2>
        <p>Sports are a BIG deal for the Samoan community. They believe in being active from a young age and getting involved in a lot of physical activities other than farming and gardening. The MOST dominant sports in Samoa include ruggby and volleyball. When you plan on driving around in the afternoons, you would find in almost every village people playing volleyball in their dirt courts and rugby in their front lawns. Of course, other sports exist like basketball and athetics, but they aren't as exposed and developed compared to the two mentioned.</p>    
        
        <h2>Rugby</h2>
        <p>Rugby has a strong hold and great meaning to Samoa. Kids would grow up playing this sport imagining themselves playing in the Manu Samoa (International rugby team). Lakapi Samoa (formerly known as the Samoa Rugby Union) is the organization that runs the development of the sport in Samoa, click <a href="https://www.lakapisamoa.com" target="_blank">here</a> to visit their page.</p>

        <h4>International Rugby Teams</h4>
        <p>One of the International rugby teams for Samoa is called the 'Manu Samoa'. This team represents Samoa in the XV aside tournaments. They have been to the Rugby World Cup every time since 1991. Their records are not very impressive, but the Samoan community continues to back them. They have recently undergone a change in management, hiring a former Manu Samoa captain after terminating another former Manu Samoa player. This has been a cause of controversy and division amongst some individuals, but things have settled and there are high expectations for the new coach, Mase Mahonri Schwalger</p>
