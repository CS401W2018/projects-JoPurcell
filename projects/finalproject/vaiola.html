        <h3>About Vaiola</h3>
        <p>Church College Vaiola is one of the three schools in Samoa under the Church Educational System. The high school was founded on the desire of people from the neighbouring village, Tapu'ele'ele, to learn and be educated. In 1967, the school was established and was given the name <span>Vaiola</span>. Vaiola means 'living water', the story behind the name goes back to when the villagers were building the school. One day, while digging for the foundation the workers were feeling thirsty. One worker moved a large rock to find a fountain of water. This worker exclaimed "VAI OLA!", which is translated to "LIVING WATER!".</p>
        <p>Vaiola is well known in the island of Samoa for their academic prowess, and sporting achievements. They have featured in many athletic and rugby competitions and have considerable success. There have been some prominent athletes developed from the school including the likes of Kelvin Masoe, Elisapeta Alofipo, and Tesimale Niupulusu. On the academic side, some notable graduates include Claudia Muagututiti'a, Lua'upu Ta'aau, Utua'ina Peti and Vaega Mau'afu.</p>
        <h3>My History with Vaiola</h3>
        <p>My family moved to Savaii in 2013. I attended Vaiola Primary School and we lived in Fa'ala, Palauli. A year later, we moved to Tapu'ele'ele, the neighbouring village to Vaiola. Then another year later, we finally moved on campus.</p>
        <p>Vaiola has been my home for 11 years. I attended school there and it was a fun journey. In my senior year, I was able to graduate with High Honour and become Valedictorian of the class of 2023. I have been blessed with the knowledge I got from the school and am proud to have been a part of it.</p>
