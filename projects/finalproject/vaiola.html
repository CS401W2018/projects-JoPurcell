        <h3>About Vaiola</h3>
        <p>Church College Vaiola is one of the three schools in Samoa under the Church Educational System. The school was founded on the desire of people from the neighbouring village, Tapu'ele'ele, to learn and be educated. In 1967, the school was established and was given the name <span>Vaiola</span>. Vaiola means 'living water', the story behind the name goes back to when the villagers were building the school. One day, while digging for the foundation the workers were feeling thirsty. One worker moved a large rock to find a fountain of water. This worker exclaimed "VAI OLA!", which is translated to "LIVING WATER!".</p>
        <h3>My History with Vaiola</h3>
        <p>My family moved to Savaii in 2013. I attended Vaiola Primary School and we lived in Fa'ala, Palauli. A year later, we moved to Tapu'ele'ele, the neighbouring village to Vaiola. Then another year later, we finally moved on campus.</p>
