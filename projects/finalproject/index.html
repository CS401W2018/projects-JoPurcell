        <h1>Welcome to Samoa Matalasi!</h1>
        <p>Samoa is a country found in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. It is hard to spot on the map but it is just to the left of the International Date Line (IDL). Prepare to explore what I love about my home land. You will learn about the culture, the different islands, landmarks and more. I have also included my home village and an added bonus, you can create a postcard for yourself or even someone you love!</p>
