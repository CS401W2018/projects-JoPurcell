        <h2>Welcome to Samoa Matalasi!</h2>
        <p>Samoa is a country found in the heart of the Pacific Ocean. It is hard to spot on the map but it is just to the left of the International Date Line (IDL). Prepare to explore what I love about my home land. You will learn about the culture, the different islands, landmarks and more. I have also included my home village. As an added bonus, you can create a postcard for yourself or even someone you love.</p>

                    <h2>Loid Forger</h2>
                    <p>Loid Forger is really a spy, code name; Twilight. He became a spy because he wanted to create a world where children will not have to cry and feel powerless. The master of disguise, clever and cunning, but sometimes tends to make quick assumptions about people based on their expressions. Don't believe me? Just ask Yor.</p>

                    <h2>Anya Forger</h2>
                    <p>She was adopted by Loid from an orphanage. She has been with four previous families and was returned each time. She is a telepath. Her past is very shady as she was a part of an experiment. Anya is bright and very impressionable. She has a very genuine desire to help those around her, like her best friend, Becky.</p>

                    <h2>Yor Forger</h2>
                    <p>An ordinary woman by day and an assassin by night. Yor Forger is the adoptive mother and wife of Loid Forger. She is very protective of Anya and tries to perform her motherly duties as best she can (except cooking. It's terrible!) She is a strong fighter, but can be clueless out of her work as an assassin sometimes.</p>
