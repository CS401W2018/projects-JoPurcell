            <h1>Aganu'u</h1>
            <p>Aganu'u (Samoan translation for culture) is an important part of Samoa. The aganu'u or Fa'asamoa is taught to children and that teaching is continued as they grow to be ali'i (noble men) and tama'ita'i (noble women) in the community.</p>
            <aside id="beside">
                <h3>Fa'asamoa: The Samoan Way</h3>
                <p>The Fa'asamoa is an important part to the Samoan culture. It means everything from head to toe. It involves being respectful to our community and environment. The Fa'asamoa is more than just a guideline, it is a lifestyle. We don't merely present our culture just for entertainment, it is the way we live every day.</p>
                <p>Samoans may seem mean and reserved when you first meet them. They may seem intimidating with their size and features. However, the Fa'asamoa teaches us to embrace those who visit us. We welcome our guests with open arms and warm smiles. We are an open culture and we firmly believe in the power of people united.</p>
                <p>We are an understanding culture and we love to teach others about our culture. We are a proud people, for we know that there is no other way we would rather live than the Fa'asamoa. The Samoan Way. We are told to remember our roots, when we leave Samoa.</p>

            <h3>Religion</h3>
            <p>Christianity was introduced in Samoa in 1830 when the missionary John Williams landed on the shores of Sapapali'i, Savai'i. There is a memorial built in Sapali'i in memory of his impact on Samoa. You can read more about this in the <a href="landmarks.html">Landmarks</a> page. Prior to the arrival of Christianity, Samoa was a war country with much little history of having peace. However, the arrival of Christianity changed that.</p>
            <p>There are villages in Samoa that have a 'Sa' or an evening prayer curfew. Be sure to avoid walking around the village during these times. The time for the Sa is normally between 6-7pm. However, you will be alerted that a Sa has begun by the sound of a conch shell or a bell. This period of time lasts for 10 to 30 minutes. A third bell marks the end of the curfew and you are free to go out again.</p>

            <h3>Siva Samoa (Samoa Traditional Dance)</h3>
            <p>Siva is an important part of the Samoan culture. It is a way to exercise your body and mind. It is away for us to welcome people, remember our culture and share a story. Many resorts and hotels in Samoa offer 'Fiafia Night' where you can watch Samoan entertainment and even possibly join in the fun.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Siva: <span>a slow, graceful and fluid form of dance, normally performed by young women.</span> Watch the video below to learn how to Siva Samoa with Miss Samoa 1997, Mary Jane Mckibbin-Schwenke.</li>
                <li>Fa'ataupati: <span>a fast, energetic slap dance. It can be performed by both men and women in traditional attire.</span></li>
                <li>Sasa: <span>a dance performed while sitting and patting your lap. Movements are performed to the sound of a fast drumbeat, or percussive striking of a rolled mat or large bamboo stalk.</span></li>
                <li>Siva Afi: <span>the fire knife dance. Young boys or men and young women twirl a knife that has flames on both ends to the sound of a drumbeat. Women often use ceremonial knives.</span></li>
                <li>Taualuga: <span>the most important siva. Traditionally, this is performed by the son or daughter of the village high chief. It is a sacred form of dance that required only virgins to dance. Though not strictly required anymore, it is still widely performed by young, unmarried dancers. This is reserved as the grand finale to any Samoan event.</span></li>

            <h3>Language</h3>
            <p>Gagana Samoa or Samoan is the national language of Samoa. English is spoken, but this can be a complication when you go out to explore the villages and outlying islands of Samoa. See the table below for some helpful Samoan phrases. Showing an effort to learn the language can show respect and will be something locals will appreciate from you.</p>

            <h3>Tatoos</h3>
            <p>Traditional Samoan tatoos or tatau have a sacred meaning to Samoan culture rather than just a decoration. Tatoos are earned by those who have served in the family and community. It symbolizes that the individual is resilient, culturally wise, and respected.</p>
            <p>Men receive what we call a <span>soga'imiti</span> or <span>tatau</span>. The pattern of the tatau covers the lower body to the knee. It shows that the man is a full member of the aumaga (untitled men) and high chiefs (matai).</p>
            <p>Women are given a <span>malu</span>. The pattern covers their upper thigh to behind their knee. It shows that they are ready and mature to do family responsibility and higher community work. They are advised to cover it as 'malu' also means <span>sacred</span>.</p>
