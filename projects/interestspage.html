        <p>I have so many interests. I love music, cuisine, culture, dancing and nature. However, I would like to say I'm <strong>extremely</strong> interested in sports, especially basketball and rugby.</p>
        <h2>Why do I love these sports?</h2>
        <h3>Rugby Union</h3>
        <p>Growing up in Samoa, rugby is the most dominant sport. Kids would play rugby in some field, while the adults were playing volleyball. I had no other choice but to play rugby.
            The game grew on me. I had a dream to play it professionally, but my physique just couldn't meet the requirement (apparently there are). I still watch rugby on Youtube or television.</p>
        <h3>Basketball</h3>
        <p>I got into basketball when my dream of becoming a professional rugby player was dashed. I played along with some friends and slowly got into it more and more.
            I do have a dream of one day making the NBA, but it feels like a long shot. I love the thrill of the game. The skill, strategy and grit you need to have to win an evenly matched game.
            I find it very fun and invigorating.
