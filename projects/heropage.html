        <h2>Daniel Carter</h2>
        <p>Growing up watching rugby, I was a huge fan of Daniel Carter. He was the All Blacks fly half (rugby number 10) and I agree with those who say he is the GOAT.
            He had the skills, the agility and the speed to match. Watching him play as a child was so exhilarating for me. With his famous left boot, Daniel Carter is my hero in rugby.
