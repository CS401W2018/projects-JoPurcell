        <h2>Rugby Hero - Daniel Carter</h2>
        <p>Growing up watching rugby, I was a huge fan of Daniel Carter. He was the All Blacks fly half (rugby number 10) and <span>I agree with those who say he is the GOAT.</span>
            He had the skills, the agility and the speed to match. Watching him play as a child was so exhilarating for me. With his famous left boot, Daniel Carter is my hero in rugby.

        <h2>Basketball Hero - Dwayne Wade</h2>
        <p>I am a Miami Heat fan. I had a debate with who I should put here between Jimmy Butler and Dwayne Wade. Ultimately, I had to go with "the Flash". My dad speaks highy of Dwayne Wade and how he managed to lead the Heat to a Championship in 2006.
            I ended up watching some of his highlights, and I ended up becoming a big fan of the Heat AND Wade. Drafted in 2003, he went on to win 3 NBA Championships with the Miami Heat. <span>I believe he is in the top 5 shooting guards of all time.</span>
