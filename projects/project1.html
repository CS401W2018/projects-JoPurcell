    <h2>XML, XHTML, HTML, HTML5</h2>
    <p>These are all markup languages. However, XML doesn't do anything. It only wraps information in tags. It only focuses on data.
        XHTML is a much stricter version of HTML. It doesn't have any mercy on you when you make mistakes in tag names or organizing your web page.
        HTML is the standard markup language  for web pages. HTML5 is the latest version, that we are using now.
