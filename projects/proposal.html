        <h2>Topic: Samoa</h2>
        <h2>Why?</h2>
            <p>I thought this topic can help me share what I love about my homeland. I was feeling a little homesick, too.</p>
        <h2>What will be on the home page?</h2>
            <p>On the home page, I will have a brief history of Samoa and some important and interesting information about the country. I will also list out the other pages and a brief preview of their content.</p>
        <h2>Page Contents</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Culture and its significance</li>
            <li>Sports History (where the table will be)</li>
            <li>Landmarks</li>
            <li>The two islands</li>
            <li>My Home: Vaiola</li>
        </ol>
        <p>I will be collecting data on sports teams from Samoa and place them in the table. I will be focusing on the dominant sports in the country being rugby and volleyball. I will try searching this information using;</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samoa_national_rugby_union_team">Wikipedia</a></li>
            <li><a href="https://www.lakapisamoa.com/">Lakapi Samoa</a> website</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I will be collecting information in my form as a postcard. I will collect the person's full name, the intended address, date and an option for a special message to the receiver. I will be using free images from Pexels and from my camera roll.</p>
